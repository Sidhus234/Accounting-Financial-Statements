# Depreciation
Assets become old and obselete with time. During each period, a portion of the cost of these assets is being used up. The portion being used up is called depreciation. 
__Depreciation:__ Year after year the asset becomes older and loses some of its market value. It is shown as an expense in the Income Statement. Two main methods used for depreciation are:
<ol>
  <li><b>Straight Line Depreciation:</b>It considers the initial cost of the cost, and its salvage value (which is how much the asset will be worth at the end of its useful life. Then the straight line annual depricaiton is defined as deifference betwen initial cost and salvage value divided by number of years</li>
  <li><b>Depreciation Based on Use:</b>Initial cost - Salvage value divided by total activity of the asset. Multiply above number by activity each year to get the depreciation based on use number </li>
  </ol>

# Amortization
Assets that are not physical in nature like Software, Brands, Goodwill, Artistic assets are called intangible assets. Only intangible assets with finite life like software licenses are subject to amortization.
