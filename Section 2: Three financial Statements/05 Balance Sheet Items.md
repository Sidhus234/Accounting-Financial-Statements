# Balance Sheet Items:
- Every balance sheet has two sides:
  - __Companys' Assets:__ What it owns. Always on left side
  - __Companys' Liabilities:__ What it owes. Always on right side

## Asset Sides:
<ol>
  <li><b>Cash Account:</b> It shows how much of a firm's assets are cash or can easily be converted into cash. Gives us an idea of the liquidity a firm has. A business cannot function properly if sufficient cash is not available for day to day operations.</li>
  <li><b>Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):</b> money owed by the customers to the company. It reflects payment that has been earned by not yet received.</li>
  <li><b>Inventory:</b> shows the value of raw materials. Goods that are in the process of elaboration and finished goods that are ready to be sold to the customers. </li>
  <li><b>Property, Plant, & Equipment:</b> Assets vital to Business Operations. The value of propery, plant and equipment is depreicated each year</li>
  </ol>
  
 ### Examples on Assets:
 - Avaliable for sale investment securities: These can be bonds, options, futures, and shares the company bought because it had extra liquidity.
 - Deferred income taxes: are taxes the company paid now, but related to future periods. 
 - Prepaid expenses and other current assets: costs paid in advance (to be sustained in the future example next year rent)
 - Assets held for sale: Assets different than investment securities, the company wants to sell.
  
## Liabilities
<ol>
  <li><b>Accounts Payable:</b> When a company buys raw material for its production process, it registers the amount in accounts payable until the actual payment has been made. The firm owes its suppliers a given amount of money because it received the goods.</li>
  <li><b>Financial Liabilities:</b>  Bank Loans (usually required for operations)</li>
  <li><b>Ownership Claims:</b> Paid-in capital which the firm technically owes to its shareholders. This capital would not be repaid to the shareholders. Shareholders will receive a decent amount of dividents, if the company is successful.</li>
  </ol>
  
  ### Examples for Liabilities:
  - Accrued and other liabilities: Liabilities reflecting income statement expenses that have not been paid.
  - Current Liabilities held for sale: The liabilities of a project or entity held for sale. 
  - Debt due within one year: Debt that needs to be repaid within the next 12 months.
  - Deferred Income Taxes: Taxes that are due but have not been paid yet.
  - Other Noncurrent liabilities: A generic category grouping several types of liabilities (Pension benefits, Other postretirement benefits, Uncertain tax positions, and Other)
