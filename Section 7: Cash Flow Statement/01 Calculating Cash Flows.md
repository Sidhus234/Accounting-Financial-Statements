Profit does not equal Cash. For example

- A company has a net income of $1,000,000. The company has 30 days to repay a portion of its debt which equal to $500,000. Two clients are not paying their invoices, which are equal to $75,000. The company has $300,000 in its bank account which is insufficient for the debt payment. This is a profitable business but has liquidity issues. If the company can't collect the revenue from the clients, there is a risk of being unable to repay its loan. 

Cash flow generation and liquidity are vital to all businesses. A company must be able to measure the actual amount of money it makes and estimate its future capital needs. 

### The cash flow statement identifies:
- How much cash is coming in and going out
- It shows whether regular operations generate enough cash to sustain the business
- It indicates whether enough cash is made to service existing debt and pay interest expenses. 
- It shows whether the firm can invest in new opportunities when they arise.
