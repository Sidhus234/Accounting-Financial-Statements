# Three components of Cash Flows:
- __Operations Cash Flows:__ Cash flow changes deriving from the Income Statement can be considered as operating. Ther term __operating__ implies these cash flows are part of core business. Consisting of cash transactions affecting the firm's Net Income.
- __Investing Cash Flows:__ Investments in Fixed Assets and Other Long-term Investments.
- __Financing Cash Flows:__ Cash transactions affecting a firm's capital structure. 

Its important to distinguish between these parts. For example, a company that generates lot of cash from operating activities, but need too much to pay for financial liabilities may be a dangerous situation.
Sum of three types of Cash flows (Operating, Investing, and Financing) gives us Net Cash Flows
Ending Cash Balance - Begining Cash Balance = Net Cash Flow
