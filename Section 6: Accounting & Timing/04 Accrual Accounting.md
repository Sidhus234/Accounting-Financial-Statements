# Accrual Accounting
Revenues are not always recorded at the same time as the exchange of cash. Accrual accounting ensures that a firm records its economic operations in the period when they have been carried out. Hence, revenue is recorded when it is earned, and costs are captured when they are incurred. 
Four types of Accrued Accounting Principles are:
- __Unearned Revenue:__ will be registered in situations when we receive products or goods that has not been delivered to client. It is recorded as a liability, as work needs to be done or the money has to be paid back. Once work is done, the liability is released, and revenue is earned.
- __Accrued Revenue:__ when a firm has provided goods to a client, but not yet received the payment. The amount is captured in Trade Receivables. When the client pays the money, the Trade Receivables go down, and cash account go up
- __Prepaid Expenses:__ are recorded when company pays some of its expenses ahead of its time. The firm sends an advance payment for a service that will be obtained in the future. This is a cost that will be sustained in the next few periods, but has already been paid. Cash decreases, and prepaid expenses are registered on Company's books.  
- __Accrued Expenses:__ Costs that have been incurred, but haven't been paid. Most common ones are personnel and interest costs. Typically, companies pay to the employees at the end of the month. Accrued expenses = Trade Payables.

Accruals: An accounting entry is necessary as soon as we provide a product or a service, incur expenses or exchange cash.
