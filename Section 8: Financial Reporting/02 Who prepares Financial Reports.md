# Who Prepares Financial Reports
- Every company has employees who are responsible for gathering financial information and use it to produce useful Financial Statements.
- Financial Statements are prepared according to a specific set of rules (Local accounting principles and International accounting standards)
- __Auditing Firms__ oversee that the companies respect the accounting standards. Each company must have an independent external auditor. This has been a cornerstone of confidence in the world's financial systems.
- The benefit of audit is that it provides an assurance that the management has presented a "true and fair" view of a Company's financial performance and position.
- Companies provide __financial statements__ that provide information about a company's financial position and performance. These statements are used by Shareholders, Bnaks, Suppliers, and Customers. 
- To enhance the degree of confidence of stakeholders in Company's financial statements, an external party is engaged to examine financial statements. This is also required by law.
- All financial statements include a __note from auditor__ which certifies (or doesn't) that these financial statements have been verified. This is important, and help us realize what is behind the figures presented.
