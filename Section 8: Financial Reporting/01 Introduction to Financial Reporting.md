# Working with Financial Statements
Financial statements hsow the development of a company's business throughout the preceding period (quarter, semester or a year). Large firms provide greater amount of detail. A financial statement contains:
- Balance Sheet
- Income Statement
- Cash Flow
- Management Discussion
- Footnotes (Mostly provided by large companies). Footnotes can be useful as they allow us to understand what stands behind aggregated figures.

Listed firms have to provide a financial reports every 3 months. (Smaller firms may provide it only once per year). In  US, the annual financial statement is known as Form 10-K. It is produced once per year, and shows how the company performed during the last 12 months. Some companies include their 10-K report within their annual report.
