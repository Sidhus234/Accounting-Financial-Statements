# Revenue Recognition Principle
- The amount of sales a company makes is a measure of how large the business is and how it performed in comparison to previous periods. Some of the critical questions investors ask befor ebuying the shares of a company:
  - Did the business grow?
  - Did it grow faster than the rest of the companies in the industry?
  - Is the business slowing down and entering a phase of decline?
  - How likely is it that this performance will continue in the future?

Hence financial authorities must ensure all companies report their revenues in a consistent and unbiased manner. Comapnies also must follow certain set of rules that impedes them from recognising revenue earlier or later. 

Recognising revenues in different time (other than when it was earned) can make a huge difference:
- Earlier recognition improves the revenue for that year, and hence improve performance over last time period.
- This will also make firm's business appear in much beter shape than it actually is
- Entities like FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) and IASB (international accounting standard's board) have created rigid ruls to ensure proper revenue recognition. Revenue is recognized in the income statement when it is realized or relizable and earned. 
- SEC guideines on revenue recognition (Below rules must be satisfied to book revenuw in a certain period):
  - Revenue should be recognized when there is evidence of an arrangement between the Buyer and the Seller.
  - The Product has been delivered or the services has been rendered.
  - The price is determined or determinable.
  - The seller is reasonable sure of collecting money.
