# Historical Cost Vs Fair Value
There can a significant difference between the recorded price of assets and liabilities based on whether it is market price or acquired price. For example a firm owns office space in PARIS, 20 years ago at $5 Million USD. Due to rapid growth of the real estate market and the location of the property, the office is now worth $35 million USD. Here the historical cost is $5 Million USD, and Market Price is $35 million USD. 
Companies are allowed to choose between the two methods, and have to be consistent. They can't switch between the two methods, and must pick one. This then applies to all assets in the same category. 
Estimation of fair value can be tricky topic, and hence companies hire a consultant to provide fair market value. The consultant looks at similar transactions in the area, and provides an estimate. 
Fair value accounting is most often used for following type of assets and liabilities:
- Real Estate
- Brand Value
- Trademarks
- Other fixed and intangible assets
- Debts
- Pensions
