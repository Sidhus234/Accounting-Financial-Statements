# General Ledger
is a account that helps us organize information about a firm's balance sheet or income statement items. 
A firm will have following general ledger accounts on the asset side:
- Cash
- Accounts receivable
- Inventory
- Property, Plant & Equipment

Usually General Ledger has Subsuduary Ledgers which contain the respective details of the account. For example an Accounts Receivables (sub-ledger) will have information on amount each customer owes. An Inventory (sub-ledger) will show the information between raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods.
