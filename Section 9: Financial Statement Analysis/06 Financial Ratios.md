# Financial Ratios
Key goal of financial ratios is to measure 4 key dimensions:
- __Liquidity:__ is firm's capability to pay its short term obligations. When we say a company is liquid, it means a significant portions of its assets are easily convertible to cash at short notice. Commonly used ratios are:
  - Current Ratio: Short term assets/short term liabilities. It allows us to have some idea about company's ability to pay short term liabilities. (Ratio above 2 is considered good) 
  - Net Trade Cycle: shows how many days it takes for a company to convert resources that it uses in production of its good into cash, also known as the cash conversion cycle. This measures the amount of time each dollar is tied up for the production and sales process before it is converted to cash. It is calculated as: Net Trade Cycle = DSO + DIO - DPO . This calculation allows us to understand if the firm is efficient in its use of capital. A peer comparison is important for this.
- __Solvency:__ is company's ability to meet its long term obligations. If a company finances a high portion of its asset with debt, then it runs the risk having financial difficulties due to increasing interest expenses. Commonly used ratios are:
  - Debt Ratio: (Also known as leverage) shows what portion of the company's assets is financed with debt. It is calculated as (Total Liabilities / Total Assets). The smaller this is, the more sustainable the business. For many industries value upto 0.67 is acceptable, but however compare it with peers. 
  - Interest Coverage: is calculated as (EBIT)/(Interest Expenses). If it is higher than 2, then company is able to repay its interest and some principle. A ratio less than 1 means the company is insolvent.
- __Profitability:__ is firm's ability to generate profits. Given that there can be several drivers which tells whether the company is profitable, it is common practice to break down some of the profitability ratios into smaller ingredients. Commonly used ratios are:
  - Return on Assets (ROA): (EBIT/Total assets). Indicator of profitability of the company, without considering the way its activites were financed.
  - Return on Equity (ROE): (Net Income/ Total Equity). It shows how much profit was generated by the company, with the money its shareholders invested in its activity.
